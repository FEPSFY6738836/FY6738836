      One of the most crucial points in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is the upscaling process so that after clinical trials it can be produced on a large scale and ready for commercialisation,
      so that is more readily available to everyone. The upscaling process is carried out by mass production of pharma products and batch processing, which allow for medication,
      vaccines and other pharma products to be produced on previously unparalleled scale, all of which allow the products to be more cost-effective and widely available. 
      Overall, the upscaling process of pharmaceutical products is a very important and rapidly evolving industry, showing ever increasing innovations in the field leading to greater manufacturing
      speeds and shortening the time its takes for the product to be readily available to the public providing lifesaving treatments to so many who need it.

The upscaling of pharmaceutical production from the laboratory to an industrial level is a pivotal part of the chemical and healthcare industry, that is very important to meeting the ever-increasing demand for 
medicinal/pharmaceutical products used in our everyday lives, it is an industry that is evolving and is rife with innovation, adapting to the constantly changing world of healthcare, providing new and difficult
problem that need solving.
The importance of this process of upscaling cannot be understated as the “The seamless scaling up of pharmaceutical manufacturing is essential for ensuring patient safety and maximizing the potential of success
for a new drug when it goes to market.” How to Scale Up Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (ascendiapharma.com). Ascendia Pharma
I have highlighted just a few of the details about the process of upscaling pharmaceutical products, however over the course of this paper I will delve deeper into the intricacies of this industry, 
showing how the industry has evolved to become more; cost effective, efficient and sustainable giving recent examples.

         Main Article
The upscaling of the production of pharmaceutical isn’t a simple process that just involves increasing the raw materials and reactants, it’s a complex process that involves; Process development,
scale up parameters (batch size, mixing speed and time, flow rates and temperature/humidity control), all of which may be vastly different from those tested in the laboratory due to many external factors including: 
•	Scale factors – one of the fundamental reasons for differences in the effect of scale, is because in the laboratory you are typically using smaller quantities of raw materials, reactants and equipment.
However, when scaled up to industrial level many factors such as heat transfer and kinetics can cause these reactions to act differently.
•	Equipment differences - When using equipment in the laboratory it is often used for experimentation, however on an industrial level, the main aim is large scale production designed for efficiency.
It is often stated that; ‘the most critical points in the production of pharmaceutical products is mass production, the upscaling of the manufacturing process so a drug can be produced on a larger scale for
commercialization and clinical trials. ‘ How to Scale Up Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (ascendiapharma.com).	 Ascendia Pharma. This statement encapsulates the importance of pharmaceutical mass production, 
as the quicker a safe, and regulatory approved drug production can be upscaled the more lives can be saved. This is no more evident than in the recent example of the Covid-19 pandemic in which the vaccine,
went from clinical trials and being safely approved to mass produced on a unrivalled scale, with the current number of vaccines that had been produced being close to 14 billion,
with ’11.2 Billion being produced in a year’,(see figure 1) Felix Richter (2021) ‘Covid-19 vaccine from zero to 11.2 billion in a year’ .
